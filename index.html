    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        I am a University of Richmond alumni with a Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science and a minor in Business Administration. I grew up playing video games as a simple hobby, however, this sparked curiosity and I wanted to learn more about both the innerworkings of a computer and how video games are made. I hope to use the same genuine passion and ambition that originally pushed me into the world of coding to explore more areas of computer science and define the future it entails.
